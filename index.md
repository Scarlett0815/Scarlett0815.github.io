# Bio

I am a senior undergraduate from School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China. I am currently majoring in computer science, and my research interests include **quantum computing**, **compiler** and **operating systems**.

# Research Experience

**2023-07 ~ now: summer intern in UCSD Prof. Yufei Ding's group**<br>

We are building a compiler-centric optimization framework for quantum computing. This compiler is capable of  deploying quantum programs onto the hardware based on photonic quantum devices. My work is to optimize the performance of a basic framework proposed by Picasso Lab, OneQ: A Compilation Framework for Photonic One-Way Quantum Computation, from the perspectives of algorithms, diversity in resource states, and physical realism.<br>
